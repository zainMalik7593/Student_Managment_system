# University Enrollment Administration Apparatus

This intricate academic management infrastructure was deliberately forged utilizing PHP and a relational databse to effectively govern an assortment of pedagogical operations throughout fluctuating timetables and classrooms within an institutional context of learning. The contraption backs diversified participation validation, reserved seating designations, standing governance, module progress tracking, retrospective chronicling, profile customization, and intuitive access through a data-driven interface.

## Capabilities

- Spontaneous Attendance Detection: Accounts for mobile class occasions while adjudicating truants reliant on unchecked participation.

- Designated Seating: Places in explicit lessons and slots can solely be reserved once. If already filled, they become unavailable for that period.

- Standing Management:

- Continue: Spots held.

- Complete: No reservation.

- Left: No reservation.

- Freeze: Temporarily excludes pupils with places freed for leave or absence.

- Module Tracking: Charts completion advancement for each student's curriculum.

- Attendance Chronicles: Allows singular or entire class viewing and printing inside opted date scopes.

- Student Profile Customization: Learners can administer uploaded account visuals internally.

- Efficient Record Access: All records across the contraption remain easily reachable through a databank for efficient administration.

## Setup Instructions

1. Import the furnished MySQL database file from the `database` folder.

2. Confirm that the connection matches your storage configuration.

3. The system is now functional, handling student attendance, seat allocations, class standing monitoring, module progress tracking, attendance logs, and student profiles.
